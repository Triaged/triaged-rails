				<h3>About Triage</h3>
				<p>Triage is re-imagining how people engage with their work tools and team on a mobile device.</p>
				<p>The current reality of data silos and cumbersome workflows prevents people from being productive on the devices used most today. By integrating with services already used by most modern companies, Triage increases awareness, improves communication, and simplifies workflows. </p>
				<p>If the future is distributed systems, and API’s are the ties that bind, then Triage is the bridge between a user and their work tools.</p>
				<p>The company currently has three employees and has raised a significant seed round from world class investors. You will join as #4 with competitive salary and significant equity.</p>
